# Django E-Learning Platform with CMS and Caching

This project demonstrates how to build a flexible and scalable e-learning platform using Django. The platform includes a Content Management System (CMS) for instructors to create and manage courses, as well as student registration and enrollment systems. It also integrates caching mechanisms to optimize performance, making the platform efficient and responsive.

## Features

- **Custom Models for CMS**: Flexible models for courses, modules, and content types.
- **Class-Based Views and Mixins**: Efficient and reusable code for building the CMS.
- **Formsets and Model Formsets**: Simplified course module and content management.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Reordering of course modules and content with an intuitive JavaScript feature.
- **Student Registration System**: Students can register and enroll in courses.
- **Diverse Content Rendering**: Support for text, images, videos, and documents.
- **Caching**: Optimizes performance by caching content using Memcached and Redis.
- **Access Control**: Group and permission-based access management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Django-E-Learning-Platform.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Django-E-Learning-Platform
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser to access the admin interface:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser to see the platform in action.

## Features in Detail

### CMS for Course Management
The CMS allows instructors to create and manage courses, including modules and content. The content can include various types of media (text, images, videos, and documents), making it easy to design diverse learning experiences.

### Student Registration and Enrollment
Students can register on the platform and enroll in courses. Once enrolled, they can access course materials based on the permissions set by the instructor.

### Content Rendering and Caching
The platform supports various content types for course modules and utilizes Django's caching system to improve performance. Memcached and Redis are used as cache backends to store frequently accessed content and reduce database load.

### Drag-and-Drop Module Reordering
Instructors can reorder course modules and their contents using a drag-and-drop interface, improving the usability of the platform.

### Permissions and Groups
The platform uses Django's built-in permissions system to manage user access, ensuring that instructors, students, and administrators have the appropriate levels of access.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: The primary web framework for building the e-learning platform.
- **Memcached and Redis**: Cache backends used to optimize content delivery and performance.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing drag-and-drop functionality.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the front-end of the platform.
